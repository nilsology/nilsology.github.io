Hi there, my name is Nils Koppelmann, online though I go by nilsology. Basically I am a self-employed webdeveloper and design enthusiastic person.

I started this blog to from time to time portrait my ideas on the technical aspects of life, therefore this weblog wont (as of now) focus on anything style or fashion related.

**Disclaimer**: This is not my business site. For business inquiries please visit [nilskoppelmann.de](http://nilskoppelmann.de).
