  title: A VPN In 10 Minutes, Basically
---


Normally a VPN especially with openVPN is quite struggle to setup, so what if you quickly want to tunnel to a foreign network or any location for that matter?

Of course you could go with a VPN service like [tunnelr](https://tunnelr.com) for 5 bucks and that for sure is easy, but if say you only need that service for just a few hours, then there are a few alternatives; and in this post I’m going to show you one of those.

Example:

> Going to a conference with a few thousand other people on venue is fine, but if generally speaking those people are capable of sniffing your WiFi connection and therefore - given not every connection is going over HTTPS (or SSL for that matter) - implying a more or less basic threat to the security of your system, securing your connection through a VPN might be a good idea.

## Our goal

Since we want all incoming and outgoing connections to be tunneled to a 3rd party server we need a few things:
- a VPS (Virtual Private Server) with root privileges to allow for maximum flexibilit
- a firewall of choice (on the VPS)
- pre-generated SSH-Keys (optional)

For the VPS I chose [digitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com) since the allow very flexible droplet creation, but more on that later. My Firewall of choice is [iptables](.) since it is quick to setup and easy to maintain once you understand how it works.

## Let the games begin

### SSH Keys

So before we begin spinning up the server we should generate ourselves some SSH-Keys. If you already have some you can just skip this step.

``$ ssh-keygen -t rsa``

Just follow the instructions. You don’t need to supply a special passphrase, but you can if you feel the need to do that.

Having finished creating those keys you should now have two files called `id_rsa` which is your private key and should only be stored on **your system** and `id_rsa.pub` being the key that is passed to the server for authentification.

### Digital Ocean

To start with digitalocean (DO) you first have to create an account with them and add your ways and means of payment, I chose paypal to allow quick and secure payment processing.

If in the last step you decided to use SSH-Keys you should now go into DO’s settings panel and configure an SSH-Key.

With the initial account setup finished we can go one step further and *Create a Droplet”. When initially configuring your droplet you need to keep a few things in mind like:
- where do you want your data-stream on the other end to “come out”?
- how much traffic are you going to process through the VPN? Under normal circumstances its safe to go for one of the lower end droplets, but you can change that later on in the process

![Create Droplet Screen]({{site.url}}/post_images/vpn-post-create-droplet-1.png)

For the Linux distribution, please choose the latest version of debian. If you fancy any other flavor of Linux it is possible not all of the following steps will apply.

If you want to authenticate with an SSH-Key as opposed to a simple passphrase when ssh-ing into the server you will have to select one of your previously configured SSH-Keys. This cannot be changed later (per droplet).

![Create Droplet Extra Options]({{site.url}}/post_images/vpn-post-create-droplet-2.png)

If you decide not to book any extra options you are almost finished, though I advise picking a name for the droplet like “vpn server” (that is just for identifying it later).

### Networking Setup

The next steps are partly Mac specific since im using their GUI to configure network-stuff, but you should be able to adapt most of the steps to fit your own environment.

What we basically want to achieve is route all traffic through our server we just created. In your Mac’s network settings panel choose the network interface you wanto to configure the Proxy for and select the **Advanced…**-Options. In the advanced options Proxy-Panel enable the `SOCKS5 Proxy` and select it. In the fields next to it type in localhost and a port you want the traffic to be forwarded through, I chose `:8080`.

![Mac specific Network Configuration]({{site.url}}/post_images/vpn-post-mac-proxy-settings.png)

Make sure to save the settings by hitting apply.

Now … what does all this do?

Basically all the traffic on that interface is forwarded through port `:8080` on localhost. But what do we do with that traffic? What we will do is specify a local ``dynamic`` application-level port-forwarding through SSH.

> This works by allocating a socket to listen to port on the local side, optionally bound to the specified bind_address.  Whenever a connection is made to this port, the connection is forwarded over the secure channel, and the application protocol is then used to determine where to connect to from the remote machine.  Currently the SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols are supported, and ssh will act as a SOCKS server.  Only root can forward privileged ports.
[ - man ssh “-D option”]

With the knowledge of how it works we now can run `ssh`.
``$ ssh host -N -D localhost:8080``

Now that is allright and we can propably connect to our server and have all traffic forwarded, but is it what we want?

Think about being in a café that only allows connections over `:80` (HTTP) or `:443` (HTTPS). You then can’t connect to your newly created VPN. This is why we will go and connect via SSH on Port `:443`. Why 443 and not 80 you ask? Because you’d expect SSL encrypted traffic on 443 anyway so a sniffer won’t notice as opposed to traffic on port 80.

To allow us to ssh into the server on port 443 you need to change your droplets sshd-configuration `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` to have the Port property say 443 instead of the default value 22. If you have trouble using vi just use `apt-get install vim` to install Vim or any other editor that suits you.

If you install Vim make sure to add an permanent alias in `~/.aliases`:
``$ echo “alias vi=vim” > ~/.aliases``

Then restart your ssh-server: ``service ssh restart``

If you now want to connect to your droplet add the option `-p443` to the command resulting in: ``ssh host -p443``

To make the process of connecting easier you can add an entry to your ssh config file `$HOME/.ssh/config`.

```
HOST host
	HostName 0.0.0.0
	User root
	IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa # optional
```

Instead of `0.0.0.0` you put in the IP-Address you find in the droplet panel of your DO interface. If your SSH-Key is not named `id_rsa` you need to supply the path to the one you used in DO’s setup process.

Now we can securely connect to the server and use it as a tunnel, but we really want to secure the server itself by building a firewall.

Make sure `iptables` is installed otherwise install it using `apt-get install iptables`. You can see wheter or not it is installed by typing ``apt-cache search iptables``.

This post mainly goes over how-to setup a VPN for IPv4 but feel free to checkout [a post covering the IPv6 side of things with DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-configure-tools-to-use-ipv6-on-a-linux-vps).

To configure your iptables firewall go and create a file `/etc/init.d/Firewall.sh`:
```
#! /bin/bash

/sbin/iptables -P INPUT DROP
/sbin/iptables -P OUTPUT DROP
/sbin/iptables -P FORWARD DROP

/sbin/iptables -F

/sbin/iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT

# out to net
/sbin/iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --sport 443 -j ACCEPT
/sbin/iptables -A INPUT -p udp --sport 53 -j ACCEPT
/sbin/iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --sport 80 -j ACCEPT

# onto box
/sbin/iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT

/sbin/iptables -A OUTPUT -j ACCEPT

# logging
/sbin/iptables -A INPUT -j LOG --log-prefix "iptables denied: "
/sbin/iptables -A OUTPUT -j LOG --log-prefix "iptables denied: "
/sbin/iptables -A FORWARD -j LOG --log-prefix "iptables denied: "

#/sbin/iptables -A INPUT -j DROP
```

Make the file executable with `# chmod +x Firewall.sh`.

I don’t want to go into how iptables works but feel free to checkout [DigitalOcean’s post on iptables](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-firewall-using-iptables-on-ubuntu-14-04) or [this one from the ubuntu help pages](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo).

Now the only thing left to do is to make sure this script runs on startup. I did this the old-fashioned way with `update-rc.d`:  first make sure `update-rc.d` is installed and the bash-script is in `/etc/init.d/`, then go ahead and run:
`# update-rc.d Firewall.sh defaults`
To later on remove this file from being run on startup just type the following: 
`# update-rc.d -f Firewall.sh remove`.

So now we can check if we are behind a well protected firewall since we are accessing the web through it: [using the GRC ShieldsUP Service to check on that](https://www.grc.com/x/ne.dll?bh0bkyd2). After choosing the non-reverse DNS option click on the “All service ports” link to, well check all service ports.
The result should look something like the following.

Optionally you can take a snapshot of your droplet to later deploy it to multiple machines. You just need to power down your machine either with `$ shutdown` or through the droplet’s dashboard.

## Conclusion
So what are the drawbacks of this method?
As of now I haven’t found a way to get receiveing email working so it is propably not the best “full time” VPN option. Therefore Services like Tunnelr might be a more suitable solution and maybe even more flexible in the long run.

Is it a good solution for quick and dirty tunnelling? Yes.
It it a good long term solution for the above? Propably not.

But, if you want to play around with VPN and DigitalOcean that is the almost perfect chance since the costs amount to almost nothing especially if you have already put in money into your DO Account.
